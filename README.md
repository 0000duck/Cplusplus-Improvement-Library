# Cplusplus-Improvement-Library (CIL)
Data structures, algorithms and useful functions extended for C++ Library

## all.h
include all CIL headers.

## big_int.h
big integer type, the constant MAX_LEN represents the upper bound of bit_int, it's 10^(4 * MAX_LEN).

## binary_index_tree.h
1 dimension and 2 dimension binary index tree. BIT and BIT2 subscript start from 1, while BIT0 and BIT02 start from 0.

## bit_operations.h
bit operations for integer types, like lowbit, setbit, resitebit, cntbit, reversebit. 
and some combinatorics method in bits, like generate and traverse subsets or combinations.

## cil_config.h
configure to fit for all platforms and compilers.

## cil_def.h
macro definitions and type defines.

## combinatorics.h
combinatorics methonds.

## debug_kit.h
watch function, output variable name as well as it's value.

## geometry.h

## high_precision.h
another big integer type, but implemented with string.

## io.h
quick io method, RD, RDB, WR for integers, IN, OUT for all types.

## matrix.h
square matrix.

## number_theory.h
number theory methods.

## output_extended.h
operator << overload for all container types and pair type.

## palindromic_tree.h

## sorts.h
different sort functions or sort related functions.

## strings_and_sequences.h
string or sequence problems, like edit distance, LIS, LCS etc.

## string_extended.h
extended functions for string type, like split, strip etc.

## touchable_heap.h
priority_queue like, but elements in it could be changed.

## triple.h
3 elements quick type.

## union_find.h

## utility.h
